While this is not an inherent flaw, it is not stated clearly enough in the item description and I do not believe it can be seen in the photos.  JOYO does include a 2-prong adapter for use in the United States.  The adapter is much smaller than the power supply itself, which leaves the bottom of the power supply resting 1-5/8\" away from the outlet (see attached photo).  There simply doesn\\'t seem to be enough surface contact between the base of the power supply and the outlet.

Another reviewer mentioned the Shure Super 55 may have some compression characteristics -- I agree and it's a good thing; she is able to get right up to the mic, soft or screaming, it doesn't peg the meter (much) on my board. Another thing is that she *loves* the look of the Super 55 Deluxe; puts her in the mood for that 40's/50's jazz stuff she does so well :) Overall - we are very happy with the Super 55 Deluxe and I will probably get a second one for myself soon.\"),\n",

This one was one continuous piece, and only a few nubs fell out. Ok, lets test it out. I attached it to itself and pressed it together. Nice grip. Then I pulled it apart, and several bunches of nubs came tearing out as well. If I'm going to attach something to my pedal board that will bond permanently, I don't want  something that will tear itself apart and leave bald patches every time I move a pedal.

My BOSS Blues driver was just fine.  Of course the Blues Driver is a $100 pedal. It took the temps just fine.

I'm highly impressed with the improvement in the acoustic guitars tone and character. The parametric equalizer is fantastic for dialing in perfect tone. The unit is dead quiet, the only noise noted was when I tightened up the bandwidth and boosted level into the upper 3rd of its range on the parametric eq. In microphone applications the unit performs equally well and the low cut worked great for reduction of handling noise. This is a fantastic tool at a bargain price. I own an ART tube MP preamp also and this unit is definitely a solid step up from the MP. Thanks to Behringer for making great quality affordable products for musicians on a budget. The only knock I can come up with at this point is that the manual is extremely basic and if you're a new user of mic pre's you're kind of on your own.

In regards to the various sizes, I bought the \"Electric\" size and it fits my new Fender Strat perfectly.  A Fender Strat fits snugly without shifting around.  NOTE:  If you have a Les Paul style guitar, make sure to buy the \"Les Paul\" case.  If you buy this Electric case, which is what I am reviewing here,  your Les Paul will NOT fit!  Inside the case there are a couple of areas where you can put a couple of effects pedals, etc.  If you use mini-pedals, you might be able to fit four.  On the outside there is a large, zippered pocket that will fit a small laptop.  Plus, another zippered pocket that has see-thru mesh material.  The zippers are large and heavy duty.  This case is much easier to carry than your typical hard case.  Plus, it looks classy.  I\\'m glad I bought it.'),\n",

The strings on the ukulele are not of quality but the ukulele can take brand name strings and tune them correctly. The bridge and nut need filing in order to effectively play chords or scales so I would consider it a novelty uke. Perfect for a toddler or young child to use instead of an expensive instrument, but will not be good to learn on or take lessons with. False spruce top and stained mahogany back and sides give it an expensive look that kids will love. Adult supervision required as there are moving parts. I bought this for my son who is turning two years old this May. See photo for comparison of an acoustic guitar (spruce top, catalpa back and sides) vs. the soprano ukulele'),\n",

The mount that attaches to your desk has received an upgrade, allowing for a tighter fit on the boom arm stalk, and a more robust build of the mount overall. My previous mount had a D-shaped hole the boom arm stalk slipped into, which allowed for a lot of movement regardless of how tight you made the clamping screw. It was also equipped with an oversized plastic wingnut for securing the mount to the desk. The upgraded mount rectifies both those issues.\\nThe stalk mount is now round, allowing for a near tight fit, without any wobble. The mount itself appears to be a thicker casting, as well as a sliding bar style clamp system allowing for a more tighter and secure hold on your desk. I am super pleased with this arm, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great budget boom arm.'),\n",

While this is not an inherent flaw, it is not stated clearly enough in the item description and I do not believe it can be seen in the photos.  JOYO does include a 2-prong adapter for use in the United States.  The adapter is much smaller than the power supply itself, which leaves the bottom of the power supply resting 1-5/8\" away from the outlet (see attached photo).  There simply doesn\\'t seem to be enough surface contact between the base of the power supply and the outlet.

With no change other than plugging in the Shure Super 55, adjust input trim on mixer and some minor EQ, the difference in her voice was remarkable. Very even and consistent response across vocal frequency range. Some presence enhancement,  subtle and helps vocals punch through mix. Another reviewer mentioned the Shure Super 55 may have some compression characteristics -- I agree and it's a good thing; she is able to get right up to the mic, soft or screaming, it doesn't peg the meter (much) on my board. Another thing is that she *loves* the look of the Super 55 Deluxe; puts her in the mood for that 40's/50's jazz stuff she does so well :) Overall - we are very happy with the Super 55 Deluxe and I will probably get a second one for myself soon.\"),\n",

I wired bypassing the controls, plugged it into a separate volume pedal and into an amp. It works fine now but with a little hum. I may still use these in the future because they are very inexpensive. I would use a better and more expensive pickups on better quality guitars. In the future, for one of my inexpensive projects, I would probably just order the pickup without the wiring harness and controls.

On a lot of pickups in Strats the neck pickup can sound too quacky, too much twang and it over powers everything else.  These strike a very nice balance with quack and all the other harmonics that are present.  Some other vintage single coils Ive tried have too much chimey-ness in the tone, too much high, drowns out the mids, again these SSL-1s don't do that, even though there is still tons of chimey, bell-like tones, like glass breaking, very brilliant, but its balanced out with the mid and low tones as well.

If you turn on an effect  (one push is chorus, another push takes you to delay, one more push is reverb), the intensity of the effect is controlled by these settings (green the lowest amount of effect, red the highest).

This is readily available from most any big box hardware store.  I cut the foam about 4\" in length and placed the 2100 in the foam. It fits perfect. I didn\\'t seal the foam, but it is just right and tight in the mount holder. I now have a shock mount that can be used if, and when, I purchase a larger microphone. I have attached a photo.

That guy was 100% correct! I just popped out the existing mounting ring with a flat blade and my V67G slipped right in and could be tighly secured using the black mounting ring supplied with the V67G.I had read a lot of negative reviews about the MXL shockmount for this microphone so I didn't want that one.  This shockmount bears a striking resemblance to the MXL 890 shockmount that came standard with my 890 vocal mic and with the same quality of construction.  The price is definitely more than fair for what you get here!So... If you have an MXL V67G order with confidence!  I would say that this would be a much better choice than the MXL alternative.I was also blown away how fast Amazon got this thing to me!
